# Kubernetes perf-tests

This repo is dedicated for storing various Kubernetes-related performance test related tools. If you want to add your own load-test, benchmark, framework or other tool please contact with one of the Owners.

Because in general tools are independent and have their own ways of being configured or run, each subdirectory needs a separete README.md file with the description of its contents.
